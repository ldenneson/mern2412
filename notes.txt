notes on this project

This is a tutorial; this doc is to help me keep track of what I'm doing and why

youtube - traversy media playlist "Learn the MERN Stack"

    have just set up and tested server

structure
- backend
    for routes, models, controllers
    server.js is the entry point into the server

- in the root
    (not the backend folder) is where all the backend dependencies go
        so node_modules goes here



ACTIVITY:
I SETUP
(all of this stuff is found in the package.json file)
1. init - github repository ldenneson/mern2412
2. installed - express dotenv mongoose colors 
    dotenv - "so that we can have environment variables"
   installed npm i -D nodemon 
    nodemon is to watch the server.js file "so we don't have to keep restarting it"
3. in package.json, under "scripts", replace "start": "echo\"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" with
    "start: "node backend/server.js",
    "server": "nodemon backend/server.js"
